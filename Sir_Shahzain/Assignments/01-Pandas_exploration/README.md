# Pandas Essential Functions Exploration

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating essential pandas functions commonly used in data analysis. This self-exploration assignment was given by [Sir Shahzain Hassan](https://github.com/theshahzism) to understand fundamental pandas operations.

## Overview

The notebook (`main.ipynb`) covers 20 essential pandas functions and operations that are crucial for data manipulation and analysis:

1. `pd.read_csv()` - Reading CSV files
2. `head()` - Viewing first rows
3. `tail()` - Viewing last rows
4. `shape` - Getting dataset dimensions
5. `info()` - Dataset overview
6. `describe()` - Statistical summary
7. `fillna()` - Handling missing values
8. `dropna()` - Removing missing values
9. `rename()` - Renaming columns
10. `replace()` - Replacing values
11. `sort_values()` - Sorting data
12. `loc[]` - Label-based indexing
13. `iloc[]` - Integer-based indexing
14. `map()` - Value mapping
15. `apply()` - Applying functions
16. `merge()` - Combining DataFrames
17. `melt()` - Reshaping data
18. `query()` - Filtering data
19. `cut()` - Binning data
20. `rename()` - Column renaming

## Dataset

The exploration uses the `hero_stats.csv` dataset which contains statistics about various heroes including:
- Win rates
- Pick rates
- KDA ratios
- Patch information

## Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I have learned how to:
- Import and read data using pandas
- Inspect and understand dataset structure
- Handle missing values
- Transform and clean data
- Filter and sort data
- Reshape datasets
- Perform basic data analysis
- Create derived features through binning and mapping

## Requirements

- Python
- pandas library
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension to explore the pandas functions with practical examples and explanations.
